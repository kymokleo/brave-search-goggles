# Background: Brave Search Goggles

Goggles are plain text files for customizing Brave Search. They provide specific instructions for Brave Search to rank and prioritize search results, limit searches to specific domains, and block unwanted content.

See [Brave's Goggles Quickstart](https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart) for more details.
